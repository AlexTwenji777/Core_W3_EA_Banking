# BANKING

## _Description_ ##
Financial Inclusion remains one of the main obstacles to economic and human development in Africa. 
For example, across Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda only 9.1 million adults (or 13.9% of the adult population) have access to or use a commercial bank account.
The research problem is to figure out how we can predict which individuals are most likely to have or use a bank account. 
The solution will help provide an indication of the state of financial inclusion in Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda.
This is done while providing insights into some of the key demographic factors that might drive individuals’ financial outcomes.
